This document contains the command & python template code for getting video stream from raspberry pi to your PC.
I am using raspberry pi 2 with pi-camera module (v1) as hardware. My pi2 is running Raspbian OS.
After OS installation on pi, run
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo raspi-config

you will get a window with options, goto interfaces option -> camera and enable it
after reboot you will get a new tools called raspivid

just type:
raspivid -t 0

to get video preview on yor raspberry pi screen


on raspberry pi execute following command, you are free to modify settings in raspivid part

raspivid -t 0 -h 480 -w 720 -fps 25 -b 2000000 -rot 270 -o - | gst-launch-1.0 fdsrc ! h264parse ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=I420 ! jpegenc ! rtpjpegpay ! udpsink host=<YOUR_PC_IP_HERE> port=5000


following code reads the frames and displays on a window
now that we are able to receive the image as np.array, we can go ahead and implement our image processing operations in this template


import numpy as np
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(r"rtp://127.0.0.1:5000")

while True:
	ret,frame = cap.read()
	cv2.imshow("result", frame)
	if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
		break
